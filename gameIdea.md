## Game
# Title
Trail Blazers

# Game Loop
you play as a color that is in constant motion and leaves a permanant trail behind you. If another play collides with that trail then they die and their trail disappears.
as you play the game you will be trying to collect energy to use abilities.

as the game progress so does the speed - this will help make the game quicker and exciting to watch and play

all movement will be 90 degree turns

# Abilities
- temporary speed boost
- temprorary Global time stop
- a jump/tunnel/shield
- remove part of your trail

# Goal
be the last one standing

# Maybe 
as spectator who died you can create short trails ever so often (5 sec) that take 5 sec to spawn in 
the idea is to give the spectator something to do while also keeping their impact on the game minimal.

## Technical

# Player State
player will have position, energy, abilities and trail

# Controls
arrow keys or wasd, space/e/q/.. as ability => maybe have custamizable key bindings???
